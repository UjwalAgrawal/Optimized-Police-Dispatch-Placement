This project focuses on optimizing the placement of police dispatch units in urban environments to ensure rapid emergency response times. By transforming city maps into graph-based representations, the project utilizes Python and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to minimize the number of dispatch units while guaranteeing comprehensive coverage within a specified response time. The approach addresses the Minimum Dominating Set with K-Hops Reachability Condition (MDSK) problem, providing a resource-efficient solution for urban emergency services.
